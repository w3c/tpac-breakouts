# This repo includes code that validates instances of the data below. 
# The validation code parses this file and uses "id" for some aspects of validation. 
# One implication is that labels below can be changed without disrupting some of the validation code.
# However, the validation code in some cases also matches on values of "options" below, so if those change,
# you will need to change the validation code as well.
