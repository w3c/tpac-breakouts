  "summary": "A recurring theme in conversations with and surveys of Web developers is how less polished the developer experience is for the Web compared to e.g. native platforms. While some of this gap is unavoidable in a platform anchored in competing implementations of open standards, there is also likely room for a lot of improvements through better coordination of browser and dev tools providers. This breakout offers to identify such opportunities and will report on some early discussions around coordinated developer-targeting research (as was done with the <a href='https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/'>MDN DNA survey</a>) and increasing the understanding of the interoperable surface of the Web platform (as illustrated by the <a href='https://web.dev/interop-2022/'>Interop 2022 effort</a>)",
