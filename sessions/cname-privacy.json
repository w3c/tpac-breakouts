  "summary": " CNAME records have a reputation as a tool to circumvent resource-blocking and specific privacy measures. However, if used properly, they can help websites integrate third-party services without requiring third-party cookies, providing a great privacy benefit. We want to discuss how browsers could support privacy-preserving usage of CNAMEs while preventing potential abuse. Joint session with a brief overview of chrome's proposed [bounce tracking mitigations](https://github.com/wanderview/bounce-tracking-mitigations/blob/main/explainer.md) following the CNAME discussion.",
  "type": " open discussion",
  "goals": [" Hear about developer use cases and user concerns, kick off an open-minded discussion on the utility of CNAMEs. Maybe get some agreement across browsers on next steps.", "Increase awareness of bounce tracking mitigations and solicit feedback on the proposal."] ,
