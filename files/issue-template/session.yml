labels: ["session"]
body:
# This repo includes code that validates instances of the data below. 
# The validation code parses this file and uses "id" for some aspects of validation. 
# One implication is that labels below can be changed without disrupting some of the validation code.
# However, the validation code in some cases also matches on values of "options" below, so if those change,
# you will need to change the validation code as well.

        TPAC breakouts sessions are usually open to the public (including remote attendees). Please only select “Restricted” if there is a compelling reason why the session should only be open to TPAC registrants.
      options:
        - Anyone may attend (Default)
        - Restricted to TPAC registrants

        Identify sessions by their issue number in this GitHub repo (e.g., `#32, #18`). Please do not use links, just '#' followed by an issue number. Space- or comma-separated list. Note: When someone chairs 2 or more sessions, we automatically do not schedule those sessions in the same slots, so there is no need to note those conflicts there.
