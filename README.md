# Breakout and group meeting management

## Tools and documentation for meeting planners

This repository contains 
1. a set of generic tools used to schedule either group meetings (e.g., during TPAC) or breakout sessions (e.g., during TPAC or Breakouts Day). The [TPAC meeting planners wiki page](https://github.com/w3c/tpac-breakouts/wiki/For-TPAC-Meeting-Planners) documents the tools.
2. [Scheduling considerations](https://github.com/w3c/tpac-breakouts/wiki/Scheduling-considerations) to help reduce conflicts for attendees.
