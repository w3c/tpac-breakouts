# About this Repo

This repo was originally used to help organize tooling for [TPAC 2019 breakout session management](https://w3c.github.io/tpac-breakouts/).

Tooling has evolved since then, but we are still using this repo as the home for documentation about tooling to help manage TPAC breakouts, including:

* [Good Practices for Session Chairs](wiki/Good Practices for Session Chairs])
* [TPAC Breakout Policies](wiki/Policies)
