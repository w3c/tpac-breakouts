# About this Repo

This repo was originally used to help organize tooling for [TPAC 2019 breakout session management](https://w3c.github.io/tpac-breakouts/).

Tooling has evolved since then, but we are still using this repo as the home for documentation about tooling to help manage TPAC breakouts, including:

* [Good Practices for Session Chairs](wiki/Good_Practices_for_Session_Chairs)
* [TPAC Breakout Policies](wiki/Policies)

Starting in 2023 we anticipate the creation of one repo par TPAC. Please see:

* [TPAC 2023 Breakouts](https://github.com/w3c/tpac2023-breakouts/blob/main/README.md)
